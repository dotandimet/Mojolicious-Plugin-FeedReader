Revision history for perl module Mojolicious::Plugin::FeedReader

0.03 2014-04-03

  - The helper parse_feed introduced as an alias (and future replacement) for parse_rss
  - Calling parse_feed with a Mojo::DOM is not recommended because of encoding issues
  - some re-writing of how a Mojo::DOM is created from the input (no interface change)
