<p>The city isn&#8217;t just bricks and mortar any more, you know: it&#8217;s become infused with the network, code fusing with material hardware to form a new &#8220;codespace&#8221;. This is the kind of Smart City rhetoric you&#8217;ll have undoubtedly encountered over the last few years - but don’t knock it. If nothing else, it’s been generating an extraordinary visual repertoire:</p>

<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="375" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/43499784" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p>The installation algorithmically generates vector shapes based on Berio’s sketching style, then projects these onto a paper screen while a plotter draws on the shape outlines. The machine can be left to auto-generate works which Daniel sees as just souvenirs of the installation; but he also has a GUI through which to tweak the variables and steer the form of the output, using it to generate other artworks, paintings, and laser-cut 3D collages.</p>
<p>A wrap-up panel discussed the dread level of these new technologies, and explored questions of ownership around the codebase that enables and underpins these works. It ended the way these panels usually end &#8212; with the hapless panellists having to explain what art is but a performance of Trinity by Oscar Sol and Iris Heitzinger, aka <a href="http://electronicperformers.in/index.html">Electronic Performers</a>, brought the evening to a rousing conclusion.</p>

<p>An IR cam captures the dancers&#8217; movements, then uses the stage floor as a projection canvas upon which algorithmic augmentations of her movements are mapped, creating an exploration of sound, visuals and human movement through space that successfully delights and disturbs. If you have a chance to see this performance live anywhere I highly recommend it.</p>

									<p><strong>Clowns, carnivals and halls of mirrors have been used in horror stories often enough, but rarely to such effect, says Liz Sourbut</strong></p>

<p><strong><small>PS Publishing, HB £11.99</small></strong></p>
<p><em>Stardust: The Ruby Castle Stories</em> is a collection of beautifully written stories, tenuously linked by largely fleeting mentions of the actress Ruby Castle, and by various themes of illusion, carnival, failure and loss. The stories are carefully-observed reflections on human nature, each with a macabre or horrific twist. The settings range from London to post-war Germany to a future Russia following a range of characters all of whom, in their own way, are chasing ghosts.</p>
<p>The tone is often claustrophobic. In &#8220;Laburnums&#8221;, a frustrated poet who lives with her ageing mother is haunted by apparitions of her old school-friend Amma. But is Amma dead, or is she in fact a successful actress, who escaped the dreariness of everyday life? In &#8220;The Gateway&#8221;, a letter from an old friend sends Andrew chasing down memory lane to the day when he took young Claudia to the carnival and allowed her to enter the hall of mirrors alone&#8230; Don’t look for closure in these stories. Most of them end on an ambiguous note.</p>
<p>In the opening story, &#8220;B-Side&#8221;, a young chess-player, obsessed by a fear of failure, is on his way home through a night-time park when he is accosted by two of the villainous characters from Ruby Castle’s movies. This fantastical and frightening incident offers the reader the first of several sparse glimpses into the actress’s life. As the protagonists of these stories grasp at fragments of the lives of others, so the reader will find, scattered through the stories, fragments of the life-story of Ruby Castle: just often enough to justify the book’s subtitle, never quite enough to satisfy.</p>
<p>Allan’s clean, spare prose lends her stories an immediacy and authenticity that is spine-chilling. Ambiguous ghosts surface repeatedly, haunting the narrators of almost every story. But are these the ghosts of the dead, or manifestations of people who are still living and only lost? Perhaps it is the narrators who are lost, and the ghosts who have moved on with their lives. Because in the end, for all their fantastic elements, what is truly spine-chilling about these stories is Allan’s pitiless exposure of human frailties, our capacity for self-delusion, betrayal and cowardice, and the degree of courage it takes for us to overcome our failings.</p>

<p><strong><small>Orbit, HB £16.99</small></strong></p>
<p>Set in the same universe as Stross&#8217;s earlier <em>Saturn&#8217;s Children, Neptune’s Brood</em> follows the outrageous adventures of an interstellar accountant. Or, more accurately, of a historian of accounting fraud.</p>
<p>This is the first space opera I recall reading that focuses on the interstellar banking system, and at its heart is a highly intricate long con. In a universe where no faster-than-light travel is possible (but hasn&#8217;t been completely ruled out by the physics) Krina Alizond-114 is an academic accountant who specialises in studying variations on the &#8220;FTL scam&#8221;. Con artists try to persuade gullible marks that an FTL drive has in fact been invented but that something went wrong during the test flight and they just need a small advance to help them iron out the wrinkles in exchange for a share in untold future wealth. Krina and her distantly related sibling, Ana Graulle-90 have been following up clues in what looks to be the biggest FTL scam of all time. Now Ana has gone missing and as Krina goes in search of her she finds herself pursued by a murderous, non-conscious body-double. Her search takes her to the water-world of Shin-Tethys, first working her passage aboard a space-faring Church of the Fragile (the Fragile being flesh-and-bone humans, people like us) and later as prisoner-turned-crew-member of an &#8220;independent customs inspection vessel&#8221;, or privateer, captained by the bat-like Count (short for Accountant) Rudi. Once there, she is arrested, abducted, subjected to extreme forms of surgery and faces other challenges rarely encountered by academic accountants.</p>
<p><em>Neptune’s Brood</em> drips with ideas, many of them thrown away in one-liners, and Stross’s vision of a high-tech post-human future in which the colonisation of the galaxy is being financed by what is effectively a pyramid selling scheme of deferred debt is hilariously plausible. The plot, though well constructed and satisfying, is almost incidental. What matters is how this complex, metahuman world unfolds. This is science fiction as Margaret Atwood would define it: filled with spaceships and giant talking squid, not to mention bats, mermaids and reanimated skeletons. It is baroque, clever, gruesome, riotous - quite frankly, it’s a delight.</p>

<p>This conversation -</p>
<blockquote>
<div>R: What are you reading? <br/> A: It’s the new Stan Robinson novel. It’s about Pleistocene men and women. <br/> R: What, like Tony Hart’s Morph?</div>
</blockquote>
<p>- leads me to think there are people in the world who could do with being better educated about our paleolithic forebears. And this vivid, thoroughly researched and thoroughly absorbing novel could be the way. Were Tony Hart still alive, I feel sure he would agree with me. <br/><br/> A little while ago, news of the subject of Kim Stanley Robinson’s new book <a href="http://kimstanleyrobinson.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=172:coming-in-2013-ad-shaman&amp;catid=35:ksr&amp;Itemid=50">leaked onto the web</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>"I&#8217;m finishing a novel set in the ice age, about the people who made the paintings in the Chauvet-Pont-d&#8217;Arc Cave in southern France, about 32,000 years ago," he said. "I do a lot of snow camping in the Sierra, and I put my snow knowledge into it and tried to explain how we became who we are now.” <br/><br/>  &#8221;It&#8217;s only science and archaeology that allow us to write historical fiction with any accuracy,&#8221; Robinson added. &#8220;So it&#8217;s kind of science fiction in a way.&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Robinson can call his novel what he likes, and I’ve never been one to force pigeonholing definitions on a book, but I have to say it really doesn’t read like SF. There are glancingly fantastic elements to it: it is narrated not by one of the characters, but by &#8220;the third wind&#8221;, a sort of supernatural force that comes to people <em>in extremis</em> and helps them find the inner resources to push on through, something often needful in the world of this book. From time to time the p.o.v. shifts inside the head of a bear or wolverine, without altering very much. But mostly, though, <em>Shaman</em> is given over to a detailed rendering of ice-age quotidiana. The ordinary day-to-day of a small tribe of early humans, living well-enough in the summer, struggling with the cold and ever-present starvation in the long winter. <br/><br/> The narrative of <em>Shaman</em>, such as it is, concerns three things. One is young Loon being picked by the tribe’s Shaman, Thorn, as his successor, and having to learn all the lyrics to &#8220;Ebeneezer Goode&#8221;, sorry, I mean: learn all the shamanistic rites and stories. Two is Loon falling in love with and marrying a girl from a different tribe called Elga. It seems Shamans (Shamen?) aren’t supposed to marry, but Loon does so anyway. Three is a lengthy inset narrative set-piece: Elga and Loon are taken as slaves by a tribe of northerners. These people keep domesticated wolves and (because they hunt seal on the ice, amongst other things) aren’t starving all the time like our protagonists’ tribe—in other words, they are us, or more like us; and Robinson introduces them to play a variant of the game William Golding plays in <em>The Inheritors</em>. When Thorn and a geezer called Click help Elga and Loon escape, there is a prolonged, tense chase across most of the length of prehistoric France, and we’re cheering for them to get away. The only niggle is, it’s too exciting; or, to be a little more precise, it’s exciting after the manner of the standard chase-and-flight thriller. It jars a little, when read against the background of the rest of the novel, because in <em>Shaman</em> as a whole the excitement is of a completely different, and much rarer kind. Very little happens in this exteriorised, frantic, adrenalin-rushy way; and it is enormously to Robinson’s credit that, nonetheless, he manages to write this in such a way that we, as readers, are so wholly drawn in to the ordinary struggles of life. He pays us the compliment, in fact, of assuming that we will be interested in the ordinary goings-on of ordinary people. <br/><br/> In the paleolithic, these goings-on mostly concerned getting food. Other goings-on included: dealing with the elements; encountering bears and wolverines and so on that might eat you; keeping a respectful distance from the Old Folk - Neanderthals - would were also liable to kill you; telling and listening to stories. But the overwhelming sense of paleolithic life one gets from reading this novel is what it is like subsisting on little or no food for long stretches. What it feels like when your belly button is a fingers-width away from your spine. How Elga’s substantial breasts simply melt away from the withering lack of calories. One thing the novel does rather brilliantly is have you empathising with an aesthetic of female beauty that inspired the maker of the celebrated Venus of Willendorf figurine. There are many, often beautiful descriptions of landscape, weather and animals. People get on with the business of life. Sometimes they go into caves and paint animals and people on the walls. All this is related to the reader in Robinson’s leisurely, precise, unshowy but vivid prose. <br/><br/> There is less actual shamanistic stuff than I thought there was going to be: some songs and rituals, the occasional encounter with a ghost, and no spirit-flights into the northern lights or shape-changing-into-a-bear-and-back. But then again Robinson’s tenor has always been Realist. That might look like an odd thing to say about him, given that his vehicle over the years has mostly been fantastic—science fictional. But it’s so common a textual strategy in our genre as to be, really, the norm: a fantastical premise elaborated via careful research, respectful attention to the laws of science, and a style and form that owe much more to Zola than Borges: the accumulation of a great many precisely observed details, prose that aims to be as transparent and neutral as possible, the whole aesthetic game of verisimilitude. I’ve never been entirely sure why so many SF writers should want to match non-realist subjects with realist textual strategies. Perhaps where one improbability - the SFnal premise - is swallowable, adding a non-probable style is an unlikelihood too far. <br/><br/> At any rate, Robinson’s scrupulous attention to detail and plausibility pays dividends. Bottom line: you believe it. Indeed, I found myself wondering just how far Robinson went by way of practical research. When Loon eats a bear penis, and the narrator says &#8220;the penis was chewy and tasted like kidneys&#8221;, is this a canny guess by KSR, or did he pop down to his local deli and order himself a raw bear penis just to… you know? Is there a writerly equivalent to Method Acting? <br/><br/> Mind you, verisimilitude is more than just a matter of what flints people used to scrape animal hides with. It has a larger, we could say ideological component to it as well. And, slaver-Northmen aside, <em>everybody in the book is nice</em>. This is a point worth dilating upon, since it’s part of Robinson’s writerly <em>modus operandi</em>, and may have something to do with his Marmite reputation amongst readers. (To be clear: I love KSR with a genuine passion, but I know folk who do not.) Loon, through whom most of this story is filtered, is an immensely likeable individual: resourceful, charismatic, brave and enduring. But then, everybody in his tribe is nice. One of the men admits to forcing sex on his wife whether she’s in the mood or not, and all the other men are immediately and vocally horrified with him. Women are to be respected, not objectified! It’s a commendable sentiment, although I wonder how pre-historically accurate it is. KSR’s position seems to be: the default setting of humankind is basically nice. He believes that, statistical outliers aside, we all basically want to get along, to not hurt other people, to live in balance. His last novel, the marvellous <em>2312</em>, is like this too: its human characters are various and multitudinous, and some have &#8220;attitude&#8221;, but all are pretty nice, deep down, and that niceness - the capacity for collective work towards a common goal, the tendency not to oppress or exploit - is common to almost all the characters Robinson has written. His creations almost always lack inner cruelty, or mere unmotivated spitefulness, which may be a good thing. I’m not saying he’s wrong about human nature, either; although it is more my wish than my belief. <br/><br/> Another question is how timely, or otherwise, a book like this is. Caveman/woman fiction has its &lt;em&gt;en vogue&lt;/em&gt; periods, and its periods when it falls from fashion. Conceivably it is coming back into fashion—Stephen Baxter&#8217;s <em>Northland Trilogy</em> (or, strictly, the first volume, <em>Stone Spring</em>, 2010) was well received, and <em>The Croods</em> did pretty well at this year’s box office. Perhaps <em>Shaman</em> will ride a new wave of interest in the period. I’m not so sure, though. <br/><br/> The last time we saw this, I’d say, was the 70s/80s, a period I’m old enough, being older than many paleolithic individuals managed (Hah! IN YOUR FACE!) to remember pretty well. Jean M. Auel’s <em>Clan of the Cave Bear</em> (1980; there were many sequels) is doubtless less cheesy in actuality than it is in my memory of reading it as a teen; yet that memory is positively gorgozolaesque, not helped by the thought of Daryl Hannah in animal skins with her carefully coiffured, just-tangled-enough bottle-blond hair, like an LA model on a shoot. Auel’s series was huge for a while, of course, and it spoke to a set of distinctively 80s concerns, partly to do with nascent environmentalism, and the sense that civilisation had alienated us from &#8220;authentic&#8221; living. It was around this time that Walter L. Voegtlin’s &#8220;Paleolithic diet&#8221; was first promulgated, the core assumption of which is that a return to the eating habits of the sorts of people Robinson writes about is the royal road to health and fitness. <br/><br/> Before that we had the Flintstones and its analogues (all those frozen-caveman-awakens-in-the-modern-world yarns, from <em>Stig of the Dump</em> to <em>Californian Man</em>), in which comedy is generated by the ironic gap between stone age primitivism and modern day technological convenience -although I’ve never been sure whether the point here is to intimate that primitivism is buried just below the surface of modern civilised manners, or on the contrary to flatten history and insist that people &#8220;back then&#8221; were basically exactly the same as white US suburbanites, <em>no matter how far back we go</em>.<br/><br/> Robinson’s project is not like that, I think; and though I finished <em>Shaman</em> as full of respect for his prodigious gifts as a novelist and imaginer as ever, I did not, quite, fall in love with the novel the way I have with some of his earlier books. In part it may be that I found less by way of genealogical connection between those days and these. It made me glad I have no problem sourcing food in the winter; and that I have a nice brick structure to live in. Otherwise I wondered about its point of connection with modern life. But then, I’ve never eaten a raw bear penis. <br/><br/></p>

<p><strong><small>Transhumanism: A Grimoire of Alchemical Agendas<br> Scott D de Hart &amp; Joseph P Farrell<br> Feral House, PPB £14.99</small></strong></p>

<p>It’s been around a while, of course. Instantiated back in the pioneer era of the intertubes, transhumanism has been both well known to and somewhat intersectional with geek/tech, SilVal and sci-fi circles for a couple of decades. It’s a word that denotes either a proud and optimistic allegiance to a certain sort of transcendent futurity, or a complex of willfully unexamined scientisms and technofetishes, depending on who uses it and who is being described; a badge of membership or a badge of othering, in other words, like most subcultural identifiers.</p>
<p>Even as the gap grows between transhumanist philosophical doctrine and what we might call Retweet Transhumanism, the former is doing its best to get its feet under the intellectual table. The latter can be all too easily mistaken for a kind of scientism cosplay, remarkably analogous to the more dogmatic sections of science fiction fandom (wherein unexamined catechisms are reiterated enthusiastically on the internet, with an exponential decline in signal-to-noise ratio), but this is nothing unusual. While weekend punks haunted the King’s Road charging tourists for mohawk photo opportunities, the ethos that powered punk was busily revolutionising art and identity politics, working on unseen in the unglamorous interstices; the most obvious and attention-grabbing elements of any subculture are inevitably the least interesting in the long run. But it’s cropping up in social science journals, at conferences and in broadsheet science articles, because the technological underpinnings of transhumanism look a little less hypothetical than they did even five years ago. IVF babies with genes from three different parents? Increasingly subtle and ubiquitous sports doping? These are transhumanist issues, my friend!</p>
<p>As risible as Retweet Transhumanism can appear, the philosophy’s most </p>

<p><strong><small>Serpent&#8217;s Tail, PPB £11.99</small></strong></p>
<p>Elisa Brown is a lab technician, married to Derek, whose speciality is “maritime law as it applied to the Great Lakes&#8221;. It’s a stultified, low-key relationship. It’s familiar.</p>
<p>Once a year she makes the day-long trip to the grave of their dead son, Silas. “When she’s finished,&#8221; the author tells us, as flatly as he tells us everything else, “she gets back into her car and goes home.&#8221; Her Honda is twelve years old and smells of a dog the family once owned. Elisa uses an old, familiar crack in the car’s windscreen - it runs “from the lower left hand corner to to spot at eye level on the passenger side&#8221; - to orient herself on the road. It’s a habit. She seems a little frame-dependant. All of this is acceptable, if drab, until the crack disappears, reality swerves, and the Honda turns abruptly into a Dodge Intrepid.</p>
<p>Elisa now finds herself in the body of a woman with the same name, whose history is as similar to her own as it is different. In this new life, she has gained several pounds. She chews gum. Her bra is uncomfortable. Her son is less dead than a computer game designer and successful internet bully. Her marriage to Derek has come apart and they’re in counselling. Everything is familiar but not the same. Thereafter, Lennon handles themes of alienation and anomie, using Elisa’s combination of slow panic and intelligent exploration of her new existence to show us that her fit with the life she’s lost is no better than her fit with the one she’s gained.</p>
<p>Who - if anyone - is undergoing the fugue, the psychotic break, here? The original Elisa, who feels she has jumped lives? Or the “new&#8221; Elisa, who suddenly believes she is an interloper in her own life? The constant interrogation of identity, the sense of being at a loss about yourself not simply because you have changed but because the change forces you to question your entire context, gives <em>Familiar</em> a faintly Hitchcockian resonance, to go with its outright reification of the <em>Talking Heads</em> song “Road to Nowhere&#8221; and its sly nod to David Lynch’s <em>Lost Highway</em>. It also has some of Hitchcock’s mischievous humour: Lennon damps down the weirder elements of the story - its implications of quantum indeteminacy and many-worlds theory - by having Elisa navigate a crank culture of conventions and messageboards as she searches for someone who can give her an understanding of the physics of her situation. If, of course, there are any.</p>
<p>It’s a very readable novel but the part I found most readable was the beginning, that strangely matter-of-fact and melancholy narration of Elisa’s original life. These sad, stiflingly quotidian events pulled me through thirteen or fourteen pages without a thought - except to wonder why I was so immersed by the ordinary. I couldn’t, in the end, see why the book needed a quantum shift or Lucretian <em>clinamen</em> to illuminate its subject. One world, one set of ordinary human emotional dislocations, would have been enough. The moment the crack in the windscreen ceased to be a metaphor and became the conduit of an actual transition, <em>Familiar</em> became a less interesting solution to its own problem.</p>

<p><strong><small>Atlantic, PPB £12.99 / Farrar, Straus and Giroux, PPB $9.00<br/></small></strong></p>
<p>A casual bookshelf browser encountering <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>, Robin Sloan&#8217;s tantalizingly-titled debut novel, might be forgiven for expecting an aesthetic as Gothic, musty and gleefully old-fashioned as the dead-tree trade itself. The first paragraph of the novel ticks all the necessary bibliophiliac boxes - bookshop ladders so tall we cannot see the ground beneath our feet; the shadows of bats flitting over the covers.</p>
<p>Fortunately - or unfortunately - Sloan swiftly reminds us that we are in the present day, and so cracked spines and dog-eared pages must give way to laptops, browser tabs, e-books, Google, Apple, and Twitter (to reference only those technological touchstones that get a mention in the book&#8217;s first three pages). Clay Jannon, the book&#8217;s affable if vaguely sketched protagonist, is a graphic designer, coder, and occasional social media impresario newly unemployed in the wake of the recession. Desperate for a source of income, he answers a Craigslist ad and takes a job at Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s &#8220;24-hour bookstore&#8221;, a labyrinth of shelves and ladders, obscure volumes, and inscrutable categorisation: exactly the kind of place, in other words, that Clay&#8217;s Kindle-toting contemporaries have put out of business.</p>
<p>The only way an independent bookstore can stay open in San Francisco, Clay soon discovers, is to be inextricably linked to a centuries-old conspiracy. As Clay delves deeper into the world of Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s mysterious bookshop - and its no less enigmatic customers - he finds himself drawn into the world of dead-tree-books and their equally desiccated owners, even as he uses all the technological tools at his disposal (and, via a conveniently employed love interest, the resources of Google) to uncover the bookstore&#8217;s secrets and those of the Unbroken Spine, the Illuminati-esque global society of bibliophiles whose quest for the usual MacGuffins (breaking an ancient code, gaining eternal life) keeps the bookstore alive.</p>
<p>The conceit underpinning <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore - The Da Vinci Code</em> investigated with the computing power of the twenty-first-century - is a clever one. The narrative is compelling and highly readable, the prose deft and unobtrusive. The plot speeds along without too much meandering, in a straightforward manner recalling the <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> adventures Clay and Neel recall fondly from their childhoods. Such problems as arise are solved briskly and expediently, more often than not with the aid of the internet But for such an ostensible love letter to the written word, in all its myriad forms, <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> often feels surprisingly perfunctory. Clay&#8217;s relationship with his girlfriend Kat, whose only defining characteristics seem to be that she&#8217;s pretty and works for Google, comes across less a genuine human connection than a device generated by a plot algorithm. So too Neel, Clay&#8217;s best friend (like Kat, a convenient character to have on hand – his wealth allows Sloan to wave aside any financially troublesome elements of the plot). Neel’s function in the story never goes beyond the merely pragmatic. Even Penumbra himself, all wizened brows and trembling lips, remains more a type than a fully fleshed-out character, diminishing the emotional heft of their interactions.</p>
<p>"A man walking fast down a dark lonely street. Quick steps and hard breathing, all wonder and need." Thus does Clay Jannon implore his readers, in a rare moment of quiet lyricism, to remember the book he plans to write – his account of the secrets of Mr. Penumbra and his mysterious bookshop. But such promise comes too little, too late. Would that this were the book he had written.</p>

									<h3><a href="http://arcfinity.tumblr.com/post/60739925395/we-watched-leaving-planet-earth-at-the-edinburgh">We watched LEAVING PLANET EARTH at the Edinburgh International Festival</a></h3>
								
								<div class="bodytype">
									<p><strong><a href="http://www.paulreviewsbooks.co.uk">Paul F. Cockburn</a> joined a theatre audience literally transported to another place.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/093b34b304c3c41a42e454b48d870cff/tumblr_inline_mspxh1vQvh1qz4rgp.jpg"/></strong></p>

<p>The Edinburgh International Festival remains the “official&#8221; Edinburgh Festival, the Establishment against which everything else happening in the Scottish capital during August (and beyond) somehow kicks. Including, most obviously, the behemoth that is the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, which has long since overshadowed the EIF in scale. Co-ordinated, themed and commissioned years in advance, EIF retains a sense of being about “proper&#8221; (ie classical) music, opera and theatre. It’s surely a sign of the times that 2013 saw the EIF curate what was undoubtedly a work of science fiction.</p>
<p>In part, this was an offshoot of one of the 2012 EIF’s main themes: technology. <em><a href="http://www.eif.co.uk/leavingplanetearth">Leaving Planet Earth</a></em> is the extrapolation of our technological ability to move beyond our home world; and to play with the all the social, political and informatic consequences of a human mass-migration to the stars.</p>
<p>Devised by Catrin Evans and Lewis Hetherington in conjunction with <a href="http://www.gridiron.org.uk/">Scottish theatre company Grid Iron</a>, <em>Leaving Planet Earth</em> was a piece of site-specific theatre whose action took place a coach-ride away at the Edinburgh International Climbing Centre (EICC), some ten miles to the west of the capital.</p>
<p>The audience were cast as the supposed final group of humans making the “jump&#8221; to New Earth; and the drama, played out on the coach and within various parts of the EICC, unfolded as fragments of a “personal acclimatisation programme&#8221;.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/37a90be90a5e2978187588d50849c82d/tumblr_inline_mspxhgMfCE1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>

<p>Not everything is going to plan with this colonisation. From the start, there is a great emphasis on “the Pull&#8221;, a psychological condition like extreme home-sickness which eventually leaves those affected little more than lifeless husks. For “the good of the community&#8221;, and indeed humanity’s future expansion into the stars, everyone submits to constant psychological screening to keep the Pull at bay, on the understanding that those who succumb will be humanely killed.</p>
<p>However, the inspirational leader of the colonisation of New Earth, Vela, knows that something more is needed; that, to deal with the Pull once and for all, New Earth must cut its ties with the Old. Only a few know what this will actually involve: the deliberate destruction of old planet and the many thousands who chose to remain there.</p>
<p>Chillingly, for some of the characters, this isn’t their most important concern. Vela herself is beginning to show signs of the Pull, spending more time than her colleagues think wise in the facility’s Old Earth Museum. If she succumbs, what will it mean for the future of humanity as a whole?</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/d94423a4a00ded52482fdcac7d019b0d/tumblr_inline_mspxhyomWL1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>

<p>There was much to enjoy in this production, not least the challenge of working out the alternative twentieth-century timeline in which a Third World War wiped out large parts of the population, yet also enabled the development of “Jump&#8221; technology in the 1970s and the discovery of New Earth in 2005. But it was sometimes difficult to latch on to the human story.</p>
<p>The EIFF is an effective setting: it’s not every day you find yourself in an old roofed-over quarry. Its confusing mixture of inside and outside was exploited and explored by Paul Claydon’s lighting and Philip Pinsky’s soundscapes. And when the climax arrived - the symbolic cutting of all ties with Old Earth - we did feel a real sense of abandonment.</p>
